# Isaac Sim Autonomous Navigation Project

This directory is intended to hold an example Isaac Sim project for autonomous navigation with a humanoid robot.

Due to the complexity of Isaac Sim projects, this directory is currently a placeholder. To create a functional project, you would typically:

1.  Create a new Isaac Sim project.
2.  Import the humanoid robot URDF.
3.  Set up the environment with obstacles.
4.  Integrate the Isaac ROS Nav2 stack for navigation.
5.  Write Python scripts to control the simulation and the robot.
