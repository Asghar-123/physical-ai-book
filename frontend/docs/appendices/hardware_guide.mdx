# Hardware Buying Guide for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Building and experimenting with physical AI and humanoid robots requires specific hardware. This guide provides recommendations for workstations, development boards, and essential sensors to get you started.

## Workstation Recommendations

A powerful workstation is crucial for running simulations (Gazebo, Isaac Sim), training AI models, and compiling complex robotics software.

### Key Components:

-   **CPU**: High core count (Intel i7/i9, AMD Ryzen 7/9) for compiling large codebases and running multi-threaded simulations.
-   **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX series (minimum RTX 3060, recommended RTX 4070 Ti or higher). NVIDIA GPUs are essential for Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and AI model training due to CUDA support.
-   **RAM**: 32GB DDR4 (minimum), 64GB+ (recommended) for large simulations and data processing.
-   **Storage**: 1TB NVMe SSD (minimum), 2TB+ (recommended) for fast access to datasets and system files.

## Development Boards for Robots

For deploying AI models and control algorithms directly onto robots, embedded development boards are used.

### NVIDIA Jetson Platform:

-   **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano / NX**: Excellent for entry-level to mid-range robotics projects. Offers good performance for running small to medium AI models and ROS 2 applications.
    -   *Pros*: Compact, power-efficient, good GPU performance for its size.
    -   *Cons*: Limited RAM compared to workstations.
-   **NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin**: For more demanding applications requiring higher AI inference and compute capabilities.
    -   *Pros*: High performance, ideal for complex perception and navigation tasks.
    -   *Cons*: Higher cost, larger form factor.

## Essential Sensors

### Cameras:

-   **Intel RealSense Depth Cameras (D435i, D455)**: Industry standard for RGB-D data. Provides accurate depth information, essential for 3D perception, object detection, and SLAM.
-   **Stereo Cameras**: For applications where depth perception is critical and an active IR projector might interfere or is not suitable.

### LiDAR:

-   **RPLIDAR A1/A2/A3 (2D LiDAR)**: Cost-effective options for 2D mapping and obstacle avoidance.
-   **Velodyne Puck LITE (3D LiDAR)**: For more advanced 3D perception and mapping, though significantly more expensive.

### IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):

-   Many development boards (like Jetson) have integrated IMUs.
-   For external IMUs, consider robust industrial-grade sensors if high accuracy and reliability are critical for dynamic tasks like humanoid balancing.

## Actuators and Motors

-   **Dynamixel Servos (e.g., XL330, XM430, XW540 series)**: Popular in humanoid robotics for their precision, feedback capabilities (position, velocity, current), and easy integration with ROS 2.
    -   *Considerations*: Torque, speed, and communication protocol (usually custom serial).

## Networking

-   **Gigabit Ethernet / Wi-Fi 6**: For high-bandwidth communication between robot components and your workstation, especially when streaming sensor data or deploying complex models.

## Software Environment

-   **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**: Recommended operating system for ROS 2 development.
-   **ROS 2 Humble / Iron**: Choose a stable ROS 2 distribution.
-   **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit & cuDNN**: Ensure these are installed and configured for GPU acceleration.

This guide provides a starting point. Your specific hardware choices will depend on your project's scope, budget, and performance requirements.
