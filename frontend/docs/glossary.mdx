This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout this textbook.

## A

**Action**: In ROS 2, a goal-oriented communication mechanism for long-running tasks that provides feedback and allows preemption.

**Actuator**: A component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system. Converts energy into mechanical force or motion.

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: The simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

**Algorithm**: A set of rules or instructions followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

**ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)**: The technology that allows spoken language to be converted into written text.

## C

**CoM (Center of Mass)**: The unique point where the weighted relative position of the distributed mass sums to zero. Crucial for robot stability.

**CUDA**: NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model that enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of GPUs.

## D

**DDS (Data Distribution Service)**: A middleware protocol and API standard for real-time systems that ROS 2 uses for its communication layer.

**Deep Learning**: A subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.

**Digital Twin**: A virtual model designed to accurately reflect a physical object. In robotics, it's a simulated robot and environment.

**DoF (Degrees of Freedom)**: The number of independent parameters that define the configuration of a mechanical system.

**Domain Randomization**: A technique used in simulation to train robust machine learning models by randomizing non-essential aspects of the simulation environment.

## G

**Gazebo**: A powerful 3D robot simulator that accurately simulates robots and their environments.

**GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**: A specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. Essential for AI and simulation.

## H

**Humanoid Robot**: A robot that resembles the human body in shape, with a torso, head, two arms, and two legs.

## I

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: An electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the orientation of the body, using a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes.

**Isaac ROS**: NVIDIA's collection of hardware-accelerated packages for perception, navigation, and manipulation, built on ROS 2 and designed for NVIDIA GPUs.

**Isaac Sim**: NVIDIA's scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool, built on Omniverse.

## J

**Joint**: A mechanical component in a robot that connects two rigid bodies (links) and allows for controlled relative motion between them.

## L

**LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: A remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth. Used by robots for mapping and navigation.

**Link**: A rigid body segment of a robot model, typically defined in URDF.

**LLM (Large Language Model)**: A type of artificial intelligence model trained on a massive amount of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text.

**Locomotion**: The act or power of moving from place to place. In robotics, it refers to how a robot moves (e.g., walking, rolling).

## M

**Manipulation**: The act of handling or controlling an object. In robotics, it refers to a robot's ability to grasp, lift, and move objects.

**MoveIt**: The most widely used software for mobile manipulation and provides an easy-to-use platform for developing new robotic applications.

## N

**Nav2**: The ROS 2 Navigation Stack, providing a complete solution for autonomous robot navigation.

**Node**: An executable process within a ROS 2 system that performs computations.

## O

**Object Detection**: A computer vision technique that identifies and localizes objects within an image or video.

## P

**Path Planning**: The process of finding a sequence of valid configurations that moves a robot from a start configuration to a goal configuration while avoiding obstacles.

**Perception**: The robot's ability to interpret sensor data to understand its environment.

**Publisher**: A ROS 2 node that sends messages to a topic.

## Q

**QoS (Quality of Service)**: A set of mechanisms in DDS (and thus ROS 2) that allows users to configure the reliability, durability, and other characteristics of message communication.

## R

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: An AI framework for LLMs that retrieves factual information from an external knowledge base to ground its responses, reducing hallucinations.

**rclpy**: The Python client library for ROS 2.

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: An open-source, flexible framework for writing robot software, designed for distributed systems, real-time control, and embedded systems.

**RViz**: A 3D visualizer for ROS.

## S

**SDF (Simulation Description Format)**: An XML format used in Gazebo to describe robots and environments.

**Sensor**: A device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment.

**Service**: In ROS 2, a request/reply communication mechanism used when a node needs to send a request to another node and wait for a response.

**SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.

**Subscriber**: A ROS 2 node that receives messages from a topic.

**Synthetic Data Generation**: The process of creating artificial data in a simulated environment to train machine learning models.

## T

**Topic**: In ROS 2, a broadcast communication mechanism where nodes publish messages and other nodes subscribe to receive them.

## U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML file format used in ROS to describe all aspects of a robot model, including its kinematics, visual, and collision properties.

## V

**VLA (Vision-Language-Action)**: A robotics pipeline that integrates computer vision, natural language understanding (LLMs), and robotic action to enable robots to perform tasks based on human commands.

**VSLAM (Visual SLAM)**: SLAM performed primarily using visual sensor data (cameras).

## Z

**ZMP (Zero Moment Point)**: A concept used in robotics to maintain dynamic stability for bipedal robots. It's the point on the ground where the net moment of all forces equals zero.
