**Goal**: Readers can interact with an embedded RAG chatbot that accurately answers questions strictly from the book's content.
**Independent Test**: Query the chatbot with questions from the book, receive accurate answers with citations, and use text highlighting to get context-specific responses.

- [x] T027 [US5] Set up Qdrant Cloud vector store and embedding strategy in `qdrant/setup_scripts/`

### Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] T039 Review all chapters for accuracy, reproducibility, and clarity in `frontend/docs/`

- [x] T041 Generate comprehensive hardware buying guide in `frontend/docs/appendices/hardware_guide.mdx`
- [x] T042 Generate cloud alternative guide in `frontend/docs/appendices/cloud_guide.mdx`
- [x] T043 Finalize glossary and references in `frontend/docs/glossary.mdx` and `frontend/docs/references.mdx`
- [ ] T044 Ensure all figures and diagrams are present and correctly formatted in `frontend/docs/`
- [ ] T045 Perform Flesch-Kincaid readability check across all content in `frontend/docs/`

## User Story Dependencies

- User Story 1 (ROS 2 Fundamentals) is a prerequisite for all other robotics-focused user stories (US2, US3, US4).
- User Story 2 (Digital Twin) is dependent on User Story 1.
- User Story 3 (AI Perception & Autonomous Navigation) is dependent on User Story 1 and User Story 2.
- User Story 4 (VLA Capstone) is dependent on User Story 1, User Story 2, and potentially User Story 3 (for full integration).
- User Story 5 (RAG Chatbot) is largely independent of the robotics modules, but its content will draw from all book modules.

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

Many tasks within user stories are marked with `[P]` indicating they can be implemented in parallel with other `[P]` tasks within the same or different user stories, provided their direct dependencies are met. For example:

- Within US1, writing the `rclpy` control chapter (T017) and creating the example ROS 2 package (T018) can be done in parallel.
- The development of the RAG Chatbot (US5) can largely proceed in parallel with the initial robotics modules (US1, US2), as it primarily depends on the book content rather than the robotics implementation itself.

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow an MVP-first approach, prioritizing the core robotics fundamentals (US1, US2) and the RAG chatbot (US5) to provide early value. Subsequent user stories (US4, then US3) will build upon these foundations, ensuring incremental delivery and testability at each stage. The final phase will focus on polishing and cross-cutting concerns like documentation and overall quality.

## Suggested MVP Scope

- **User Story 1**: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) Fundamentals
- **User Story 2**: Digital Twin Creation and Sensor Integration
- **User Story 5**: Integrated RAG Chatbot for Book Content
